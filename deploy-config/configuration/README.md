# Demo Stitch Repository

[`bootstrap.yaml`](bootstrap.yaml) will add a `stitch.GitSource` pointing to public Stitch demo repository at https://github.com/xebialabs-community/stitch-by-example.git. This will trigger automatic Stitch scan for this repository and all the rules and macros will be available in the system.
