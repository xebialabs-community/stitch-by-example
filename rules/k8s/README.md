# Kubernetes Stitch rules and macros
Subset of Stitch rules and macros for Kubernetes deployments gives more advanced overview of the stitch capabilities. 

Most of the features and capabilities are described in more details in README.md files across sub-directories. 

**Notice:** Some of the features are only applicable for the kubernetes deployments (e.g. pre-/post-processing rules).
